I&#8217;ve been reading about SOPA, Its very sad, Entertainment industry has taken the litigation route.

On the Brighter Side, SOPA has made protesting against it, easier than ever.

<!--more-->

How?

Simple, Sing your favorite song and upload it to youtube. If you are not feeling adventurous, make it anonymous, by uploading it under a new account created with new email. Technically, Its still not bullet proof, but the more people do this, the more harder it is to crack down.

Show a Sign, or annotate the video with &#8220;Stop SOPA&#8221; Message

Here you Go. Thank Entertainment Industry for making possible, the Easiest Revolution Ever.
