Ever Since I Upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04, the Brightness lock doesn&#8217;t work, After every few seconds it keeps reverting back to highest brightness level. While, I haven&#8217;t figured out the perfect solution, I relatively less painful temporary fix.

Only when I use the Fn + brightness keys in the keyboard, the brightness keeps reverting back to highest brightness. However, When I open the &#8220;Brightness &amp; Lock&#8221; and drag the brightness slider, it seems to maintain the brightness setting until shutdown. Unfortunately after booting up I have to do this again.

Here the setting I use in 13.04

Hope it helps!
